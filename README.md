# UniSwitcher

Scene switcher &amp; data propagator wrapper for Unity3D

# Requirements

UniSwitcher requires the following plugins to work.  
The versions are the earliest ones I personally checked with; it is possible that this still works with later versions.

* Unity 2020.x
* [Zenject](https://github.com/modesttree/Zenject) v9.1.0
* [UniTask](https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask) v2.0.31

# See it in action

Play `Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity`. It transitions into `SecondScene.unity` after 3 seconds of transition.
