## [1.2.3]

### Removed
* ADVANCED.md file has been removed. Its content is now in [wiki](https://github.com/Clpsplug/UniSwitcher/wiki).

## [1.2.2]
### Added
* Added equality methods to `BaseScene`

### Changed
* [Breaking] `IScene.GetRawValue()` (as method) is now `IScene.RawValue` (as property.)
* Development Unity version is now 2021.3.

## [1.2.1]
### Added
* UPM Support!
* Changelogs. Past changes are also included.
* Abstract class `BaseScene`, an implementation of `IScene`.  
  Extend this class to focus on avoiding typing scene path in full!

## [1.2.0]
### Added

* Added `StartedFromAnotherSceneMarker`. ([#12](https://github.com/Clpsplug/UniSwitcher/pull/12))

### Changed

* Although this has been the case for the UnityPackage file from the first version, the repository itself no longer contains dependencies.
  Instead, they are downloaded via UPM, so there is no apparent change when you pull the repository to play with this code.

## [1.1.0]
### Changed
* [BREAKING!] `Fire()` is now an asynchronous method.
  * Please change any `void Fire()` to `async UniTask Fire()`

### Deprecated
* `ISceneEntryPoint.IsHeld()` is no longer considered because `Fire()` is asynchronous.  
  It should be deleted and any need to hold the transition should be done using UniTask's task handling

## [1.0.0]
## Added
* Initial Release!
